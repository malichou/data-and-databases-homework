    "# Homework 2: SQL in Python (Data and Databases 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next four homework assignments will be in this iPython notebook format. Read the instructions as you go, and type in the necessary code--then run the cells to see if you got it right. Don't worry if you are new to python for this assignment--the only \"code\" you will be writing are SQL statements that you will paste into each myquery variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework we will be using the tables we imported from the [UN data site](http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx). You should already have `wind` and `solar` installed. As you will see, this homework asks that you find one more table of your choice from the UN's Energy statistics an import it into the the same database. [I have posted the instructions here](http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/csv_to_sql.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are relatively simple CSV files--the only really important columns are `country`, `year` and `usage`. But the tricky part is that most countries have multiple entries: one for every year the UN has been gathering data on that country. So most of these queries are going to ask you to get electrical usage results based on country and year. (Major hint: JOINs are going to need to be based on country AND year.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the questions below, we focus on exploratory queries--with an emphasis on aggregates and joins. Read the questions carefully, and then write SQL statements that will get you the correct results. (You will want to explore tables and test out queries directly in the shell before you paste them into Python--the error handling for SQL in Python can be confusing, and there should be no errors in the prewritten Python parts of this document. Also, sometimes an error in Python will break your connection with the database--see conn.rollback() below for that solution.\n"
